# Crab Age Prediction  

This project predicts the **age of crabs** based on their physical measurements using **machine learning regression models**.   

---

## roject Overview  
- Goal: Predict the age of a crab from measurable features (like length, weight, diameter, etc.)  
- Type: Supervised Machine Learning (Regression)  
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn  

---

## Dataset  
- **Features**: Physical measurements of crabs (e.g., Length, Diameter, Height, Weight).  
- **Target**: Age (measured in years).  
- Rows: ~X samples (replace with actual number)

##  Workflow  
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering & Scaling  
4. Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
5. Evaluation (RMSE, RÂ² score)
